AI Cores Design Outline:

1. Core Structure: Design the core structure to be compact and efficient, allowing for high performance and low power consumption.

2. AI Acceleration: The cores should be optimized for AI computations. This could involve specialized instruction sets or hardware features that accelerate common AI tasks.

3. Scalability: The design should allow for scalability, enabling the addition of more cores for increased performance as needed.

4. Integration: The cores should be designed to integrate seamlessly with the other components of the GPU, such as the memory and the main processing units.

5. Cooling: Consider the heat generation of the cores and design appropriate cooling mechanisms to prevent overheating.

6. Manufacturing: The design should take into account the manufacturing process, ensuring that the cores can be produced using available semiconductor fabrication technologies.
