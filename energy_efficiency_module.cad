Energy Efficiency Module Design Outline:

1. Power Management: Design an advanced power management system that dynamically adjusts power consumption based on workload, ensuring optimal performance while minimizing energy use.

2. Low-Power States: Implement low-power states for when the GPU is idle or performing less intensive tasks, further reducing power consumption.

3. Efficient Architecture: The module should be designed to work seamlessly with the innovative architecture and AI cores, maximizing their performance while minimizing energy use.

4. Cooling: Design efficient cooling mechanisms that use less energy. This could involve passive cooling techniques or advanced materials that dissipate heat more effectively.

5. Energy Monitoring: Include features that allow users to monitor the GPU's energy use in real-time, helping them understand and manage its power consumption.

6. Manufacturing: As with the AI cores, the design should take into account the manufacturing process, ensuring that the energy efficiency module can be produced using available semiconductor fabrication technologies.
